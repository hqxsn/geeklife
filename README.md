Geek life
------
**Geeklife** is the git records the things what I made during the 13 years as a developer.

I just realized that I didn't have the good habit to collect the things I made or collected.
So I decide use here to accomplish the goal. Also I will use here as the different angle of
my CV.

## Personal introduction
------
I am Andy Song (My chinese name is “宋楠” with pinyin "song nan"). I was burned @ 11/1978 
The timestamp was knowns by many 50s ~ 70s generation Chinese people.

I graduated from Zhengzhou university (as you know it belongs to 211 series) @ 2000, and 
my main domain is about Information technology and Computer Science.

I feel lucky because I have the twins (boy and girl, In China means Dragon and Phoenix).

I have worked 13 years in the software industry. I used many language for developing. I 
always believe that no any language or method could fit all cases, so I will try my best
seek the better ones for the suitable scenarios.
